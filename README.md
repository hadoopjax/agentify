# agentify

Describe a feature. Claude and GPT-5.4 plan the issues. Codex codes them in parallel. Claude reviews and merges. You approve.

```
agentify plan "Add OAuth login with Google and GitHub"
agentify group
agentify approve <epic-id>
agentify run
```

## How it works

```
 You describe a feature
        ↓
 Claude proposes issues ←→ GPT-5.4 critiques
        ↓
 Dashboard: approve / reject each issue
        ↓
 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  Worker 1: #42 coding...                 │
 │  Worker 2: #43 reviewing...              │
 │  Worker 3: #44 merging...                │
 │          (parallel worktrees)            │
 └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
        ↓
 All issues done → epic complete → plan next
```

### Planning

1. `agentify plan "description"` or type it in the dashboard
2. Claude reads the codebase, proposes issues as structured JSON
3. GPT-5.4 critiques the plan — flags issues too large, spots gaps, adds suggestions
4. You approve/reject in the dashboard or via `agentify approve <id>`
5. Approved issues get the `agent` label

### Triage

Point agentify at a repo with existing issues:

1. `agentify triage` lists open issues that haven't been triaged
2. Dashboard shows a **Triage** section with all untriaged issues
3. **Assign** adds the `agent` label — the loop will pick it up
4. **Skip** adds `agent-skip` — hides it from future triage
5. Issues already labeled `agent`, `agent-wip`, or `agent-skip` are excluded

### Group Existing Issues

1. `agentify group` asks Claude to cluster eligible open issues into epic proposals
2. GPT-5.4 critiques the grouping for overlap, missing groups, and unsafe sequencing
3. agentify stores the approved-local proposal in `.agentify/epics/*.json`
4. Existing issues in a grouped proposal are reserved locally so triage will not assign them twice
5. Approving a grouped epic starts only its first execution wave by labeling those issues `agent`
6. Later waves unlock automatically after the prior wave closes
7. Existing-issue epics execute one issue at a time within each epic, so different epics can run in parallel without same-epic merge collisions
8. Existing-issue grouping is intentionally conservative: only 2-issue groups survive, and if GPT flags a Claude group as unsafe, agentify drops it and returns those issues to the ungrouped pool

### Execution

1. Dispatcher picks up to N issues labeled `agent` (default: 3 concurrent)
2. Each issue gets its own **git worktree** + background worker process
3. Worker claims the issue (swaps `agent` → `agent-wip` label)
4. Codex codes in the worktree — your checkout stays on `main`
5. Opens a PR, waits for CI
6. Claude reviews the diff — LGTM or requests changes
7. One retry with feedback if changes requested
8. Merges on approval, cleans up, picks next issue
9. When all epic issues close, marks epic complete

## Setup

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hadoopjax/agentify.git
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/agentify/bin"

# Requires: gh, codex, claude, jq, python3
cd your-repo

# Add agent-only keys
mkdir -p .agentify
cat > .agentify/agent.env <<EOF
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GH_TOKEN=ghp_...
EOF

agentify init
agentify run
```

agentify loads `.agentify/agent.env` only. Keep agent credentials separate from your app's `.env`.

### Run in Docker / Colima

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hadoopjax/agentify.git
cd your-repo

# Add agent-only keys
mkdir -p .agentify
cat > .agentify/agent.env <<EOF
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GH_TOKEN=ghp_...
EOF

# Start (builds image on first run)
/path/to/agentify/start.sh
```

`start.sh` builds the image if needed, reads `.agentify/agent.env`, injects only `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `GH_TOKEN`, and starts the loop with dashboard.

Dashboard at `http://localhost:4242`. With Tailscale, accessible from any device on your tailnet.

## Commands

```
agentify run              Start the loop + dashboard
agentify plan "desc"      Plan an epic (Claude + GPT-5.4 dialectic)
agentify group            Group existing issues into epic proposals
agentify approve <id>     Approve all pending issues for an epic
agentify triage           Review existing issues — assign or skip
agentify init             Create agent/agent-wip/agent-skip labels
agentify test             Create a test issue
agentify dashboard        Open just the dashboard
agentify status           Show state + recent activity
```

## Options

```
--concurrency N      Parallel workers (default: 3)
--max-runs N         Stop after N completed runs (0 = unlimited)
--poll N             Seconds between idle checks (default: 60)
--port N             Dashboard port (default: 4242)
--codex-model M      Codex model (default: gpt-5.4)
--codex-effort L     Reasoning effort: low, medium, high (default: high)
--claude-model M     Claude model (default: claude-opus-4-6)
--no-dashboard       Skip the dashboard
```

## Per-repo config

Drop `.agentify/agents.md` in your repo with project-specific context:

```markdown
- We use pnpm, not npm
- API routes are in src/routes/
- All PRs must include tests
- Never modify the generated/ directory
```

Both Codex and Claude see this in every prompt.

State lives in the repo at `.agentify/`:
- `state.json` — global counters
- `events.jsonl` — event log (dashboard timeline)
- `workers/` — per-worker state files
- `worktrees/` — git worktrees (one per issue)
- `epics/` — epic plans + proposals
